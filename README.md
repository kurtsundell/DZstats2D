# DZstats2D

Two-dimensional quantitative comparison measures for bivariate data. Measures are extensions of one-dimensional counterparts commonly used in detrital geochronology and summarized in Saylor and Sundell (2016), Geosphere. The measures implememented in DZstats2D are described in Sundell and Saylor (submitted) to Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems.

### Run in MATLAB

To run DZstats2D in MATLAB open the DZstats2D.m file and run it. This code runs best in MATLAB 2018b. 

### Run without MATLAB

DZstats2D can be run in MATLAB or as a standalone .exe file (Windows) or .app file (macOS) that can be used without having a MATLAB license. The file can be run from your computer's Desktop, or wherever you choose to keep it. 

To run as a standalone program DZstats2D requires the free MATLAB Runtime Compiler 2018b version 9.5. There are separate compilers for macOS and Windows. Install the compiler first, then run the .exe (Windows) or .app (macOS).

Here are the links for the compilers (click to start download). Follow all of the default settings to install. Nothing will happen following installation -- there is no need to open the compiler -- DZstats2D will access it automatically.
